Code for Guthman et al 2019

These scripts are for use in analyzing data recorded from neurons in (primarly) whole cell patch clamp configuration. Data should be recorded as .abf files using pClamp software to be compatible with the codes. These scripts have been used and tested on data from pClamp ver 10.x and are compatible with those .abf data files.
